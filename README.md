Android app CookMe for Google Code U
Learning how to use git.
Was part of Google CodeU. Worked on this project with Eduardo Vaca (eduardo.vaca.g@gmail.com) and Nihal Shah (nihalnshah@gmail.com). We build our own server using firebase and google app engine to communicate with our app, which is a simple cooking app in which every user can upload their simple recipes and save them locally and everyone is pushed to the remote server. Added material design animations and two different search functions (multi-ingredients for local and single ingredient for remote). As an extra we only implemented the share function.
